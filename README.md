# **Simple C++ Calculator**

A basic calculator program written in C++.
It performs simple arithmetic operations using two numbers and displays the result.

## **Features**

* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* Clean and easy-to-read code
* Works directly from the terminal

## **How It Works**

1. The program asks you to enter **two numbers**.
2. You choose the operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
3. It calculates and prints the result immediately.

## **Requirements**

* Any C++ compiler (g++, clang++, MSVC, etc.)

## **How to Run**

```bash
g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator
./calculator
```

## **Future Improvements**

* Support for more operations
* Input validation
* Repeating calculations without restarting the program
